      <p class="p-L description__item">
        Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands
        and statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family.
        The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting
        for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.
      </p>
      <p class="p-L">
        We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get sick,
        feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87
        volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals
        are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached
        to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
